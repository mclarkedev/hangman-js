# hangman-js
A small hangman app created to help me continue to define various Javascript usages.

I created this small front-end web app to better understand the usage of the following Javascript tools:
  1) Promises and Async/Await
  2) Connecting with APIs
  3) Error handling
  4) Javascript Classes and Constructors
  5) ES6 Syntax
  
 Doing so allowed me to experiment between two asynchronous processes, Callback functions and Promises, ultimately picking the best option for the job.
 This also proved to be great practice in keeping an OOP mindset.
